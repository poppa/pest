# Pest - A simple Pike unit test framework

This unit test framework is just in its infancy. Although it is, on its surface,
heaviliy inspired by [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), I have no intentions of making
a Jest implementation in Pike. Jest has more than 1,100 contributors and
probably a couple to 100,000 lines of code.
